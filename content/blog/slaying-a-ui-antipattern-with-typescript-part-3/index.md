In [part 1](blog/slaying-a-ui-antipattern-with-typescript) and [part 2](blog/slaying-a-ui-antipattern-with-typescript-part-2), we have enforced views for all the stages of fetching data on the front end. All thanks to a very simple data structure originally made for Elm.

One thing we need to cover for the app to have the benefits of an Elm app is **decoding**.

After discovering how well decoding works in TypeScript, I feel dirty when not using it.

## Validating what comes in

**We do server side validation on web forms. Why shouldn't the frontend validate what comes in from the backend?**

Elm actually forces you to do that, and it contributes to eliminating pretty much all runtime exceptions. When something doesn't check out, it fails fast and loud.

TypeScript lacks this feature as it only type checks what happens in the source code. The interfaces you are writing are strictly speaking just qualified guesses of what you will recieve.

If the api changes without you knowing, TypeScript wont't help you.

Luckily, a library like **Purify** or **fp-ts** can give you these guarantees with little extra effort.

## Purify the chaos

**In this final part of this series, we will use [Purify](https://gigobyte.github.io/purify/) for decoding. It has become my favourite library for TypeScript.** I prefer it because it's a simple library that gives us a few utilities and functional data structures, and does a great job of it.

[fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) is the main contender. It's very cool but seemingly crams all of Haskell or Scala into TypeScript. It's a powerful library, but it seems to be aimed at those who already are very familiar with a purely functional language.

- Use the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/remotedata-with-typescript-and-react-part-2-hlu4v?file=/src/index.tsx) from the previous post as a starter code

## Make a decoder and get a type for free

In the initial code, we have an interface of the **Post** type looking like this:

```tsx
interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  body: string;
}
```

Delete it. **Wait, what?**

As mentioned, it does not help us in type checking external data. And a puny TypeScript type guard is too weak to withstand the chaos outside your source code.

So let's install Purify

```bash
yarn install purify-ts
```

and import the needed dependencies from **Codec** in **index.ts**

```jsx
import { Codec, string, array, GetInterface, number } from "purify-ts/Codec";
```

Did you delete the **Post interface** yet? If not, do it now!

Then define this constant:

```tsx
const Post = Codec.interface({
  id: string,
  title: string,
  body: string,
});
```

This gives you the decoder. You can extract it into a TypeScript interface just by adding this line below it:

```tsx
type Post = GetInterface<typeof Post>;
```

Yes, the **const and the type are both named `Post`** ðŸ¤”. No worries, there are no naming conflicts. TypeScript is smart enough to understand when to use a type and when to use a value.

Also add these lines right below. This makes a list type so you can validate all the Posts in one operation:

```jsx
const PostList = array(Post);
type PostList = GetInterface<typeof PostList>;
```

Replace all occurrences of **`Post[]`** with **`PostList`** in the code.

## Making a type safe fetch request

Now, we only need to modify the **fetchPosts** function a bit.

```tsx
async function fetchPosts(): Promise<RemoteData<Error, PostList>> {
  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
  try {
    if (!response.ok) throw await response.json();
    const data = await response.json();

    const decodedPosts = PostList.decode(data);

    return decodedPosts.caseOf({
      Left: (err) =>
        ({ type: "FAILURE", error: Error(err) } as RemoteData<Error, PostList>),
      Right: (successData) => {
        return { type: "SUCCESS", data: successData } as RemoteData<
          Error,
          PostList
        >;
      },
    });
  } catch (e) {
    return { type: "FAILURE", error: e };
  }
}
```

The decode function typechecks the data argument every time the app fetches the data.

Don't worry if you don't get it all at first. In my opinion, this is best learned by practical use.

The **PostList.decode** function takes in the uncertain **data** value from the outside and finds out if the types checks out. It returns an **Either** value which only can return one of the two values:

1. **Left**: A container with an error message if the types aren't right
2. **Right**: A container with the correct and verified **PostList** value.

The **caseOf** function extracts the values out of the **Either** container.

If it doesn't fail, the data inside the app is now guaranteed to have the correct types.

_The convention in functional programming is that the **left** side argument is the error and **right** side is right. **Right is right**._

## Let's put it to the test

By running your code or this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/remotedata-with-typescript-and-react-part-3-9zrbd?file=/src/index.tsx) you can see the result:

![Screenshot of friendly error message](/images/archive/failing-decoder.jpg)

What ðŸ˜± Who wrote that nice error message??

The decoder of course, and it gives you a helpful error message pretty much like Elm would in this situation.

**I have been deceiving you all along.** It turns out the **id** value never was a string after all, even though we declared it as a string already in the very first part of this series.

TypeScript didn't help you catch that. Purify did.

Let's turn the **id** into a number in the Codec, and we should be all good:

```tsx
const Post = Codec.interface({
  id: number,
  title: string,
  body: string,
});
```

## What remains

Another improvement to resemble the language features of Elm in React is immutable state. A low barrier entry solution is to use the [useImmer hook](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) instead of useState.

[Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.now.sh/) supports immutability by default with redux under the hood.

Another alternative is [xState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate). I haven't explored it in-depth yet, but I understand it forces you to be very explicit about what states are possible. Sounds awesome!

These tools have good documentations and large communities, so I won't cover the usage of them in this series.

But to get the full benefits and power of Elm on your front-end, it's still best to use Elm. You can try it out on a [small component in your React app](https://github.com/cultureamp/react-elm-components) and decide wether you like it or not.

## The End
