[IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/) is a refreshing Haskell MVC framework and simple to use. It's popularly called "Haskell on Rails". The good old multi page app (MPA) is back and better than ever.

Elm is a delightful language for writing web apps. And even if it's most famous for writing single page apps (SPA), it's also great for making widgets for the MPA architecture. And it's especially satisfying to combine with IHP.

A tutorial series about the "Elm-as-widget" pattern, combines two of the world's sweetest programming languages.

A simplified version of [Richard Feldman's RealWorld SPA archtecture](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example) turns out to be very well suited for a widget-engine in IHP.
