_This is **part 3** of the series [IHP with Elm](https://driftercode.com/blog/ihp-with-elm-series)_

We have Elm set up in IHP, initialized values from flags and we are just going through the final part of making our Elm widgets fully interoperable with IHP: **HTTP requests**.

I'm happy to say that most of what we did in the last post also applies for http requests.

In `/Application/View/Show.hs`, let's

## Install elm/http

This tutorial only needs one additional package, the official `elm/http`, so let's just install that right away.

```bash
elm-json install elm/http
```

## Make the Book index output JSON in addition to HTMl

Thanks to what we have done so far, making the index view of `Book` is very simple.

Add this import in the top of `/Application/View/Books/Index.hs`

```hs
import Web.JsonTypes ( bookToJSON )
```

Then all we have to do is to add the line `json IndexView {..} = toJSON (books |> map bookToJSON)` to the bottom of this instance:

```hs
instance View IndexView where
    html IndexView { .. } = [hsx|
        <nav>
            <ol class="breadcrumb">
                <li class="breadcrumb-item active"><a href={BooksAction}>Books</a></li>
            </ol>
        </nav>
        <h1>Index <a href={pathTo NewBookAction} class="btn btn-primary ml-4">+ New</a></h1>
        <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Book</th>
                        <th></th>
                        <th></th>
                        <th></th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>{forEach books renderBook}</tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    |]

    json IndexView {..} = toJSON (books |> map bookToJSON)
```
A List of `Book` maps into a List of the `BookJSON` type we defined in the previous post and turns it into JSON.

The `/Books` endpoint will now serve you HTML by default. But if you set the header `Accept: application/json`, it will display the JSON version instead. You can test it with curl:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8000/Books
```

So, to over-explain it: Remove that header from the curl, and you'll of course get the HTML back. 

## Add a case for the Widget type

In `Application/Helper/View.hs`, all we need is adding another case in the data type. This widget won't have any data, but will be passed as a flag to tell Elm which widget to load.

```hs
data Widget
  = BookWidget BookJSON
  | BookSearchWidget
  deriving ( Generic
           , Aeson.ToJSON
           , SOP.Generic
           , SOP.HasDatatypeInfo
           )
```

So in the same file, lets add another Elm widget entrypoint.

```hs
bookSearchWidget ::  Html
bookSearchWidget = [hsx|
    <div data-flags={encode BookSearchWidget} class="elm"></div>
|]
```

And of course, we must add the `bookSearchWidgets` in the module definition on top:

```
module Application.Helper.View (
    -- To use the built in login:
    -- module IHP.LoginSupport.Helper.View
    bookWidget,
    bookSearchWidget,
    Widget(..),
) where
```

By updating the Widget type, we can auto-generate the types:

```bash
npm start gen-types
```

Elm complain a bit not, so let's do some stuff to fix that.

## Add widget to 

Let's first create the file `/elm/Api/Http.elm`.

```bash
touch elm/Api/Http.elm
```

To make sure we remember to set the `Accept: application/json` header, let's define a wrapper around Elm's `Http.request` and call it `ihpRequest`.

The `getBooksAction` function will take in a string and a generic `msg` type taking in a `Result`. [RemoteData](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/latest/RemoteData) is of probably a better data model, but let's not cram in to many things in this lesson.

```elm
module Api.Http exposing (..)

import Api.Generated exposing (Book, bookDecoder)
import Http
import Json.Decode as D


getBooksAction : String -> (Result Http.Error (List Book) -> msg) -> Cmd msg
getBooksAction searchTerm msg =
    ihpRequest
        { method = "GET"
        , headers = []
        , url = "/Books?searchTerm=" ++ searchTerm
        , body = Http.emptyBody
        , expect = Http.expectJson msg (D.list bookDecoder)
        }

ihpRequest :
    { method : String
    , headers : List Http.Header
    , url : String
    , body : Http.Body
    , expect : Http.Expect msg
    }
    -> Cmd msg
ihpRequest { method, headers, url, body, expect } =
    Http.request
        { method = method
        , headers = [ Http.header "Accept" "application/json" ] ++ headers
        , url = url
        , body = body
        , expect = expect
        , timeout = Nothing
        , tracker = Nothing
        }

```

Then we will have to handle

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Api.Http exposing (getBooksAction)

import Html.Attributes exposing (href, placeholder, type_)

```

Up until now, it has been fairly simple to keep everything in `Main.elm`, but it is growing in complexity. The logic for each widget should probably be separated since they all have their unique individual model any way.

In the next and final lesson, we will figure out how to make a more maintainable widget architecture.
