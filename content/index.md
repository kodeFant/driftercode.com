## A blog about functional programming

I'm a budding functional programmer who used to be a journalist.

Just sharing my findings through the **learn by blogging** principle.

Mathy algebraic slang to be kept at a minimum.

_**\*** Currently working on the styling, so things might seem off at the moment._
